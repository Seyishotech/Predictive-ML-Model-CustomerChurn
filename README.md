# Predictive-ML-Model-CustomerChurn
ML model to predict customer churn using Python and scikit-learn.

# 🧠 Customer Churn Prediction with Machine Learning

This project applies machine learning to predict customer churn (i.e., whether a customer will leave a service). The goal is to help businesses proactively retain customers and improve service offerings.

## 🚀 Project Summary

- **Problem**: Many subscription-based services suffer from unpredictable churn. This model predicts churn using behavioral and demographic features.
- **Model Used**: Logistic Regression (extendable to Random Forest, XGBoost)
- **Dataset**: Public Telco customer data (simulated)
